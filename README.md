# Mental-Math-Trainer

This repository holds the code to a simple mental math trainer that allows the user to practice addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
The parameters are: 
- The solution is an integer
- Users can pick how many rounds they want to play by launching the program with math_trainer(# of rounds)
- Number ranges for different operation types
  - Addition: 1-1000
  - Division: 1-2500
  - Multiplication: 1-100
  - Subtraction: 1-100
- When you get an answer wrong, it will tell you and you can try again
- At the end, you will see a summary showing how long you took and how often you were wrong

Background: I created this little program to teach myself the basics of python.
